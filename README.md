Node-RED nodes for Siemens S7 PLC communication with dual backend support.

## Overview

s7-suite is a TypeScript-based Node-RED package for communicating with Siemens S7 PLCs. It supports multiple communication backends and is designed for both production deployments and hardware-free development.

### Highlights

**Multiple backends** — Pick the backend that fits your environment per connection:
- `nodes7` — pure JavaScript, no native compilation required
- `node-snap7` — native Snap7 library, enables advanced features like block listing, SZL reads, and CPU control
- `sim` — built-in simulator generating dynamic values (sine waves, counters, sawtooth signals) for development without a physical PLC

**Flexible address formats** — Write addresses in the style you prefer: nodes7-style (`DB1,REAL0`), IEC-style (`DB1.DBD0`), or area-style (`MW4`, `I0.1`, `QD8`). The address parser handles conversion transparently. See [Addresses and data types](#addresses-and-data-types).

**Smart polling** — The trigger node supports edge detection (`rising`, `falling`, `any`) for booleans and configurable deadband for numeric values, reducing unnecessary messages in flows.

**PLC browsing** — Discover data blocks directly from Node-RED. With snap7 this uses native block listing; with nodes7 a probe-based approach with rate limiting explores the PLC address space safely.

**Robust connections** — Connection manager with request queuing (max 100), automatic reconnection with exponential backoff, a link check while idle so the node status follows the PLC, and structured error codes (`S7Error` with error code and cause chain).

**Flexible read/write modes** — Single values, combined objects, raw buffers, structured schemas, or unpacked bit arrays.

**Bulk tag import** — Import full PLC tag lists into the read node with one click. Supported files: a TIA Portal tag table Export (`.xlsx`, `.xml` or `.sdf`), SimaticML XML from TIA Portal Openness (`.xml`), Step 7 symbol exports (`.csv`/`.tsv`), and STEP 7 V5 hardware configuration exports (`.cfg`). For CSV and Excel it auto-detects column names (`name`/`symbol`/`tag` and `address`) and separators (tab/semicolon/comma). Imported tags get human-readable labels used as object keys in the output.

**Offline CFG import** — Upload a STEP 7 `.cfg` file to discover tags and pick addresses **without a live PLC connection**. Useful for engineering offline, reviewing code, or demoing flows. The browse dialog can switch between `live` and `cfg` source on the fly.

## Features

- **s7-config** — Connection configuration with backend selection and auto-reconnect. Host, port, rack, slot, TSAPs and timeouts can each come from an environment variable, so one flow can run against different PLCs
- **s7-read** — Read PLC data in multiple output modes: single value, combined object, raw buffer, struct, or bit array
- **s7-write** — Write single values, arrays, strings or whole structs to PLC memory areas, with dynamic address via `msg.topic`
- **s7-trigger** — Polling with edge detection and deadband filtering
- **s7-browse** — Discover PLC data blocks with category filtering and search; supports both live PLC and offline `.cfg` import
- **s7-control** — CPU control actions: Start, Stop, Cold Start (snap7 backend only)

### Supported PLCs

S7-200, S7-300, S7-400, S7-1200, S7-1500, LOGO!

### Backends

| Backend | Package | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| nodes7 | `nodes7` | Pure JavaScript, no native compilation needed |
| snap7 | `node-snap7` | Native library via Snap7, optional |
| sim | built-in | Simulation backend for development and testing |

### Addresses and data types

Three address styles are accepted and can be mixed freely:

| Style | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| nodes7 | `DB1,REAL0` · `DB1,X0.3` · `DB1,INT20.3` · `DB1,STRING50.20` |
| IEC | `DB1.DBX0.3` · `DB1.DBB4` · `DB1.DBW6` · `DB1.DBD8` |
| Area | `M0.1` · `MB4` · `MW6` · `MD8` · `I0.0` · `IB0` · `QW2` · `C1` · `T2` |

What the numbers after the offset mean depends on the type:

| Address | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `DB1,X10.3` · `M10.3` | bit 3 of byte 10 (`BOOL` can be written instead of `X`) |
| `DB1,X10.3.8` · `M10.3.8` | 8 consecutive bits starting at bit 3 of byte 10 — an `Array[0..7] of Bool` |
| `DB1,INT20.3` · `MB20.3` | array of 3 values. The longer form `DB1,INT20.0.3` means the same |
| `DB1,STRING50.20` | a `STRING[20]` at offset 50. The length can be left off when writing a string that is already declared in the PLC |

An address with a length reads as an array and is written from an array of exactly that many values; a byte array also accepts a `Buffer`.

| Type | Size | Value in Node-RED | nodes7 backend |
|------|------|-------------------|----------------|
| `BOOL` / `X` | 1 bit | boolean | ✓ |
| `BYTE`, `CHAR` | 1 byte | number, 1-character string | ✓ |
| `WORD`, `INT` | 2 bytes | number | ✓ |
| `DWORD`, `DINT` | 4 bytes | number | ✓ |
| `REAL`, `LREAL` | 4 / 8 bytes | number | ✓ |
| `STRING` | length + 2 bytes | string | ✓ (reads need the length in the address) |
| `DT`, `DTZ` | 8 bytes | `Date` — a PLC `DATE_AND_TIME`, as server-local time (`DT`) or UTC (`DTZ`) | ✓ |
| `DTL`, `DTLZ` | 12 bytes | `Date` — a PLC `DTL`, as server-local time (`DTL`) or UTC (`DTLZ`) | ✓ |
| `USINT`, `UINT`, `UDINT` | 1 / 2 / 4 bytes | number | snap7 only |
| `LINT`, `ULINT` | 8 bytes | number, BigInt or string (see below) | snap7 only |
| `WSTRING` | 2 × length + 4 bytes | string | writes only; reads need snap7 |
| `DATE` | 2 bytes | string `YYYY-MM-DD` | snap7 only |
| `TIME`, `TIME_OF_DAY` | 4 bytes | number (ms) | snap7 only |
| `S5TIME` | 2 bytes | number (ms) | snap7 only |
| `DATE_AND_TIME` | 8 bytes | ISO string (UTC) | snap7 only |

The `sim` backend supports every type. Counters and timers (`C1`, `T2`) also need the snap7 backend. On the nodes7 backend an unsupported type is reported as an error that names the address, never as a silent `null`.

**Dates** — Writes to `DT`, `DTZ`, `DTL` and `DTLZ` accept a `Date`, an ISO string or milliseconds since 1970. A PLC date has no time zone: use the `Z` form when the PLC keeps UTC, the plain form when it keeps local time.

**64-bit integers** — A JavaScript number is exact only up to 2^53. The **LINT/ULINT as** setting on `s7-config` chooses how `LINT` and `ULINT` are returned: *Number* (default), *BigInt* (exact, but cannot pass through `JSON.stringify`, so not through MQTT or HTTP) or *String* (exact and safe to send anywhere). Writes accept all three.

**Strings** — A write changes only the string's current length and characters, never its declared max length or anything after it. A value longer than the string is rejected.

### Environment variables

Host, port, rack, slot, the TSAPs, the timeouts and the reconnect intervals on `s7-config` each take either a value or the name of an environment variable (pick `env` in the field's type menu). Node-RED's flow and global environment variables work as well as the process environment, so the same flow can be deployed against different PLCs. A variable that is unset, or not a number where one is needed, is reported as a config error and the node does not connect — it never falls back to a default.

`s7-trigger`'s **Interval** and **Deadband** work the same way. An unset or unusable variable stops that trigger with an error.

### Connection control

Two settings on `s7-config` let a flow manage the connection, following the pattern of Node-RED's MQTT nodes:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Auto connect | on | Connect on deploy and retry after a failure or a lost link. Off, the connection stays down until a flow sends `msg.action = "connect"`, and a failure or lost link is not retried |
| Dynamic control | off | `s7-read`, `s7-write`, `s7-control` and `s7-browse` accept `msg.action`. Off, `msg.action` is ignored, so existing flows are unaffected |

A message carrying `msg.action` acts on the connection and does **no** PLC I/O:

| `msg.action` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `connect` | Connects. Already connected is a success; a pending retry is brought forward |
| `disconnect` | Disconnects and stops retrying until told to connect |
| `reconnect` | Disconnects, then connects with the retry backoff reset |
| `status` | Sends the message on with `msg.payload` set to the connection report (below) |

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4", "name": "Line 1 PLC",
  "state": "connected", "since": 1791100000000,
  "lastError": "Connection lost", "lastErrorAt": 1791099990000,
  "backend": "snap7", "host": "192.168.0.10", "port": 102, "rack": 0, "slot": 1, "plcType": "S7-1500",
  "autoConnect": true, "allowDynamic": true, "configError": null
}
```

`state` is `connected`, `connecting`, `reconnecting`, `error` or `disconnected`, and `since` is when it entered that state. `lastError` is the most recent connect failure or lost link, kept after the connection recovers. The action affects the connection, so every node using that `s7-config` sees the result. A failed `connect` or `reconnect`, or an unknown action, is reported as the node's error, so a Catch node can handle it.

### Node API

#### s7-read

Any message triggers a read. The node reads the addresses and schema set in it; nothing in the message changes them. To take them from the message, set **Address src** or **Schema** to `msg` (or `flow`, `global`, `env`) and name the property:

| Setting | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Address src | `msg` / `flow` / `global` / `env` | An address string (space- or semicolon-separated), an array of addresses, or `{ label: address }`, whose labels become the output keys |
| Schema | `msg` / `flow` / `global` | The struct schema, as an array or a JSON string (struct mode only) |
| `msg.payload` | any | Output: read value(s) |

**Output modes:**
- **single** — `msg.payload` = single value (or object if multiple addresses)
- **object** — `msg.payload` = `{ "DB1,REAL0": 23.5, "DB1,INT4": 100 }`
- **buffer** — `msg.payload` = raw `Buffer` of the requested memory area
- **struct** — `msg.payload` = `{ fieldName: value, ... }` based on schema definition
- **bits** — `msg.payload` = `boolean[]` with each bit unpacked (LSB first per byte)

In the editor, **Add address** starts a new row from the one above it, keeping the type and notation: `DB1,REAL0` is followed by `DB1,REAL4`, `DB1.DBD0` by `DB1.DBD4`, `MW10` by `MW12` and `I0.7` by `I1.0`. Arrays and strings move past their whole length, and a label ending in a number counts on (`Temp1`, `Temp2`). The guess is selected, so typing replaces it. The struct schema lists in `s7-read` and `s7-write` do the same for **Add field**: the new field has the previous field's type, and its length for a string, at the next free offset (`STRING` at 2 with length 10 is followed by a `STRING` at 14 with length 10), or the next bit for a `BOOL`. Only the name is left to type.

If some addresses in a read fail, the rest are still sent and the failed ones are `null`, with a warning naming them. If they all fail, the node reports an error. Both backends behave the same way.

#### s7-write

The node writes to the address and with the schema set in it; nothing else in the message changes them. To take them from the message, set the address type or **Schema** to `msg` (or `flow`, `global`, `env`) and name the property:

| Setting / property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Address | `str` / `msg` / `flow` / `global` / `env` | One address string (single and struct modes), for example `msg.topic` |
| Schema | `msg` / `flow` / `global` | The struct schema, as an array or a JSON string (struct mode only) |
| `msg.payload` | any | Value to write (type must match address data type). For an address with a length (`DB1,INT20.3`), an array of that many values, or a `Buffer` for a byte array |

On success, the input message is passed through to the output.

#### s7-trigger

The node has no input: it starts polling once the PLC is connected, and is configured in the editor.

| Setting / property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Interval | `num` / `env` | Polling interval in ms, a whole number of 1 or more (default 1000) |
| Edge mode | select | `any`, `rising` or `falling` (rising and falling apply to booleans) |
| Deadband | `num` / `env` | Minimum change in a numeric value that triggers a message, 0 or more (default 0) |
| `msg.payload` | any | Output: new value |
| `msg.topic` | string | Output: address that changed |
| `msg.oldValue` | any | Output: previous value |

#### s7-browse

Send any message to trigger. Output `msg.payload` contains `{ blocks, areas, addresses, cpuInfo? }`.

#### s7-control

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `msg.payload` | string | Input: action override (`start`, `stop`, `coldstart`, `reset`) |
| `msg.payload` | object | Output: `{ action, success: true }` |

Requires the **snap7** backend. Send a message to execute the configured action, or override via `msg.payload`.

## Troubleshooting

**node-snap7 not installed** — The snap7 backend requires the native `node-snap7` package. Install it with `npm install node-snap7`. If compilation fails, ensure build tools are installed (`build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu, Xcode CLI tools on macOS).

**Connection timeout** — Verify the PLC IP is reachable (`ping <ip>`). Check that rack/slot values match your hardware. For S7-1200/1500, ensure "Permit access with PUT/GET" is enabled in the PLC settings.

**LOGO connection** — LOGO PLCs require TSAP-based connections. Set PLC Type to "LOGO" and configure Local TSAP (e.g. `0x0100`) and Remote TSAP (e.g. `0x0200`). TSAPs are hex: `0x0100`, `0100` and `01.00` (as LOGO! Soft Comfort shows them) all mean the same, and a decimal number is read as hex too.

**Address parse errors** — Verify address format. Examples: `DB1,REAL0`, `DB1.DBD0`, `MW4`, `I0.1`, `QB0`. See [Addresses and data types](#addresses-and-data-types).

**"isn't supported by the nodes7 backend"** — nodes7 has no support for that data type (see the table in [Addresses and data types](#addresses-and-data-types)). Switch the connection's backend to `snap7`.

**"bad quality for …"** — The PLC rejected the address: the DB does not exist, or the address runs past the end of the DB or area.

**Excel import does nothing** — XLSX parsing requires the SheetJS library, which is loaded on demand from a public CDN. If your Node-RED editor runs in an air-gapped environment, export your tag list as `.csv` from Excel/TIA Portal instead.

**Remote I/O via Profibus/Profinet not browsable** — The browse node scans local rack I/O (areas I/Q, M, DB, C, T) and PLC blocks. Distributed I/O addresses on remote stations (Profibus DP couplers, Profinet IO) are reachable for read/write using the standard `IB`/`IW`/`ID`/`QB`/`QW`/`QD` syntax with the absolute peripheral address, but they will not appear in the browse results since they are not enumerable through the standard S7 protocol.

**Offline browsing without a PLC** — Switch the browse dialog source from `live` to `cfg` and upload a STEP 7 `.cfg` export of your hardware configuration. Tags from the cfg are then available in the address picker just like live blocks. Sample file: [`test-assets/prod.cfg`](test-assets/prod.cfg).

## Test Assets

## Contributing and forks

Pull requests are welcome, including large ones. If you are planning a bigger
change — a dependency migration, a restructure, new nodes — please open an issue
first. We are happy to discuss it and to land substantial work here; that is
usually less effort than maintaining a parallel package, and it keeps a single
place for users to report bugs.

If you do publish a fork under its own package name, please also rename the
Node-RED node type IDs (for example `myprefix-s7-suite-*`) and use your own palette
category. Node-RED refuses to register a node type that is already claimed, so
identical type IDs make it impossible to install both packages side by side.
